Hi @BenjaminSauder. I hope this message reaches you since I could not find any other way to contact you. 
Me and many others really appreciate the work you did on this tool. It was one of the best modeling tools in 3DSMax and should have been
a native Blender tool long ago. Major Kudos.

Question: Are you planning to port this to Blender 2.8 ?
